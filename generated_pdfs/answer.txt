Other Ideas We’ve Considered

AI-Powered Triage for Mental Health Patients

In countries like Canada and the UK, mental health patients often wait up to two years for specialist care.
Many commit suicide or self-harm while waiting.
A model trained to:
  - Interact with patients and assess their mental state
  - Triage them based on urgency to help relieve overloaded systems
  - Reduce tragic outcomes by identifying high-risk cases early

LLM-Powered API Layer for Legacy Insurance Contracts

Many specialty insurance lines (municipality, hospital, long-tail liabilities) still rely on decades-old, paper-based contracts as their system of record.
Some claims are still being paid based on scanned documents with no structured access.
A LLM-powered API layer that:
  - Extracts and processes contract terms
  - Automates inquiries and decision-making
  - Modernizes legacy systems without full system replacements

AI for Fire Risk Assessment & Public Awareness

Fire risk models used by insurers today are based on static, outdated parameters that homeowners and businesses often don’t have access to.
A system that analyzes satellite imagery to assess fire expansion risks in a neighborhood, town, or entire region could:
  - Educate the public on hidden risks that insurers already use for policy assessments
  - Help homeowners take proactive action, such as:
    - Creating defensible space
    - Clearing brush
    - Strengthening fire-resistant structures
    - Adjusting coverage (e.g., adding Excess & Surplus coverage)
  - Enable insurers to refine pricing and underwriting based on:
    - Forest proximity
    - Building density
    - Wind patterns
  - Assist governments with disaster preparedness to reduce future losses and improve community resilience

These ideas align with our expertise in AI automation, structured decision-making, and real-world risk assessment, leveraging many of the core technologies we are already building.

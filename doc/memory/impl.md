# Memory Implementations

The `impl` subpackage contains concrete implementations of memory subsystems, typically corresponding to specific memory types or configurations.

## Main Class

- **ShortTermMemory**
  - A concrete implementation of a short-term memory subsystem.
  - Implements the core memory interfaces and provides the actual storage and retrieval logic for short-term memory.

## Usage

These implementations are instantiated based on memory definitions and are used by the memory manager and other system components to store, retrieve, and manage memory items.

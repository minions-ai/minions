# Minions Framework Vision Document

## Executive Summary
The Minions Framework is a sophisticated AI agent orchestration platform designed to create, manage, and deploy specialized AI agents (called "Minions") for various tasks. It provides a flexible, secure, and scalable architecture for building AI-powered applications with composable prompts and configurable behaviors.

## Core Vision
To provide a robust framework that enables developers to create specialized AI agents that can:
1. Handle complex tasks through composable prompts
2. Maintain consistent behavior across interactions
3. Scale across different domains and use cases
4. Operate with enterprise-grade security and multi-tenancy

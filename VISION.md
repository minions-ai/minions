## Getting Started
```java
// Example of creating a basic prompt
MinionPrompt prompt = MinionPrompt.builder()
    .name("CustomerServicePrompt")
    .type(MinionType.USER_DEFINED_AGENT)
    .version("1.0.0")
    .build();

// Adding components
prompt.addComponent(PromptComponent.builder()
    .type(PromptType.INSTRUCTION)
    .text("Handle customer inquiries professionally")
    .build());
```

## Future Vision
Minions aims to become the standard framework for AI agent development, providing:
- Seamless integration with existing systems
